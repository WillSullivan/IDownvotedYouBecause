                Your question contained no code
            </h1>
            <p>It's really hard to answer a question about a bug in code when the question <i>doesn't include any of the buggy code</i>.</p>
            <h2>What you did wrong</h2>
            <p>You asked a question about an issue in your code.  Perhaps it wasn't giving you the expected outcome, or was not compiling, or maybe when running it threw an exception.  However, you didn not include any relevant code.  Code that people trying to help you could examine to find your error or that could be used to reproduce the problem.</p>
            <h2>Why this is worth a downvote</h2>
            <p>As it is, the question is barely answerable. Any solution would be based on guesses.  Even if someone guessed right and you got your answer, not providing any code means it's harder to relate for future readers.  Questions that aren't useful for people other than you are discouraged on StackOverflow.</p>
            <p>It also shows that not much effort was put into writing the question. Remember, you are asking people to <i>help you, free of charge</i>.  Giving people enough information to answer your question is the least you can do.</p>
            <h2>What you can do to fix this</h2>
            <p>Edit the post to add a Minimal, Complete, Verifiable Example (see <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/help/mcve">Stack Overflow help center</a>).</p>
            <p>The code should not be <a href="http://idownvotedyoubecause.com/so/TooMuchCode">directly copy/pasted</a> from the editor or IDE! Instead, it should be cut down to only keep the parts essential to identify and reproduce the issue.</p>
            <p>That way, your issue can be quickly identified by experienced users and solved in their answers. These answers will be of higher quality and relate better to the issue posted, drawing more attention to the question (and more upvotes for you). Future readers will be able to quickly identify if the root cause of the issue relates to them.</p>
            <h2>Did this help you understand why I downvoted you?</h2>

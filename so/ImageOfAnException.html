            <h1>
                Pictures of exceptions are not helpful
            </h1>
            <p>In your question, you indicated that there was an exception thrown when your code executes. <i>That's good information</i> that we need to help you find a solution.  However, in order to find that solution, <b>we need to know the details that can be found within the exception</b>.  If your question lacks this detailed exception information, it becomes harder for us to help you.</p>
            <h2>What you did wrong</h2>
            <p>Pasting a picture of your exception is <b>not helpful</b>.  You <b>do not</b> have to prove your code threw an Exception with a picture of it--we trusted you when you stated this fact within your question.</p>
            <p><img src="images/exceptionimage1.PNG" /></p>
            <p>Pictures of Exceptions that shows some of the detail contained within the exception <i>are also not helpful</i>.</p>
            <p><img src="images/exceptionimage3.PNG" /></p>
            <h2>Why this is worth a downvote</h2>
            <p>One of the first things people do when trying to help someone with an exception is <i>they copy text from the exception and paste it into their favorite search engine</i>.  When you put an image of the exception into your question, you force people who are trying to help you--<i>for free</i>--<b>to transcribe the exception from your image</b>.  Not only is this an annoying waste of time, but also it can result in <i>transcription errors</i> and reduce the chance that the search is successful.</p>
            <p>No image can contain <b>all of the details</b> from your exception.  Exceptions contain <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stack_trace">stack traces</a> which are often very long and won't fit in an image.  Exceptions also can contain <i>inner exceptions</i> which have stack traces of their own, and <i>they</i> can have inner exceptions as well.  We need <i>all</i> that information to answer your question.  Your image isn't giving us this necessary information!</p>
            <p><i>In addition</i>, text in images isn't indexed. This makes it very hard, if not impossible, to find your question via search engines. It reduces the visibility of your question and prevents future readers from finding it.  It also prevents people who use screen readers from being able to answer your question.</p>
            <h2>Capturing exception details</h2>
            <p>
                Instead of taking a picture of the exception, <b>get a text report of all of the contents within it.</b>  This can usually be accomplished very easy, depending on what language and tools you are using.  Here are some examples of capturing these details.
            </p>
            <h3>Visual Studio and .NET</h3>
            <p>
                If you are debugging in Visual Studio, the Exception Helper Dialog contains a link that will copy all exception details to the clipboard
            </p>
            <p><img src="images/exceptionimage2.PNG" /></p>
            <p>If you are experiencing the Exception at runtime, you can <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/9526139/how-to-catch-exceptions">catch the exception</a> and call <b>ToString()</b> on it.  Log the result, using whatever method is most convenient for you.</p>            
            <h2>What to do with them</h2>
            <p>Once you have gathered all the details from the exception, you can paste it into your question in an edit.  <b>This is important</b>--do not try to paste the exception details into a <i>comment</i>, as there is not enough room for all the of details.  There is an "edit" link at the bottom of your question, click it and paste the details into your question.  And don't forget to format it!</p>
            <p>Once you have done this, leave a comment to the person who sent you this link.  They will be happy to retract their downvote.</p>
            <h2>Did this help you understand why I downvoted you?</h2>

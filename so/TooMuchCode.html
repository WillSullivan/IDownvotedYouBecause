                Please include the <i>minimum amount of code</i> in your question needed to illustrate your problem.
            </h1>
            <p>Like the proverbial needle in the hasytack, you've made it hard for people to find the error in your code.</p>
            <h2>What you did wrong</h2>
            <p>You added a huge code block inside your question. Your real problem lies only in a few instructions, and most of the code posted is completely useless to the resolution of the issue. It only generates noise, and makes it harder for those trying to answer your question.</p>
            <h2>Why this is worth a downvote</h2>
            <p>The noise generated from all the code surrounding the error prevents future users from relating your question and the answer to their own issue. The question is effectively only useful to the asker, and offers little or no value whatsoever to the community.
            </p>
            <p>It also shows that not much effort was put into creating your question. People are volunteering their time, <i>free of charge</i>, to help you. You need to be considerate of their efforts. One of the easiest, and most helpful, ways to do this is to pair down your code to the minimum needed to illustrate your problem.
            </p>
            <h2>What you can do to fix this</h2>
            <p>Isolate the issue, and create a Minimal, Complete, Verifiable example (<a href="http://stackoverflow.com/help/mcve">see the StackOverflow help center for more details</a>). Such an example is generally only a few lines of code, like a function or a database request.</p>
            <p>The code should be debugged to identify the precise spot at which the issue occurs. It should then either be rewritten from scratch until the issue reappears or the original code should be largely cut through to remove working pieces which are not directly related to the issue.</p>
            <p>For markup, remove attributes, namespaces, styles and elements that don't have anything to do with your issue.</p>
            <p>If you are worrired that something you have removed may play a part in your issue, state so in your question. Users with domain knowledge in your issue will let you know when they need to see additional information.</p>
            <p>The now minimal code can be used to replace the noisy code through an edit.  You can find an edit link at the bottom of your question.</p>
            <p>Now your code can be quickly read, understood, and fixed by answerers. Future readers will be able to notice at a glimpse if their issue relates or not to your issue.</p>
            <h2>Did this help you understand why I downvoted you?</h2>

<p>This website is designed to help people understand why you downvoted them.</p>

<p>Participation in a reputation-ranked online community comes with its ups and downs.  You post something and get upvoted when people like or agree with it.  Unfortunately, you may also be downvoted because someone didn't agree or didn't like it.  </p>

<p>The goal for IDownvotedYouBecause is to allow users an <strong>easy, productive and helpful</strong> way to let someone know <em>what the problem was</em> that caused your downvote, <em>what they can do to fix it</em>, and <em>why you think they should do so</em>.  </p>
